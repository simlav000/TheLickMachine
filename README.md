# TheLickMachine
To lick or not to lick?

This project done in the class COMP451 fundements of machine learning at McGill Univeristy was done by Simon Lavoie, Louis Bouchard, Maddy Walkington and Simon Pino-Buisson.

We use a CNN + RNN hybrid architecture to detect wheter an audio sample contains *The Lick* using computer vision on the frequency sepctrograms.
